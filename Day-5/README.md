### `Static behaviour evaluation — CMOS inverter robustness — Power supply variation`

**Overview:**

Power supply scaling directly affects the **static behavior** of a CMOS inverter — changing its switching threshold (Vm), noise margins, and overall robustness.

**SPICE Simulation:**

- The CMOS inverter is simulated at two different supply voltages:  
  `Vdd = 2.5V` → scaled down to `Vdd = 1V`
- PMOS and NMOS sizes remain constant:  
  - `Wp = 0.9375 μm`, `Wn = 0.375 μm`

✅ **Switching Threshold (Vm)**:  
As `Vdd` decreases, the inverter's switching threshold **Vm** tends to move toward the center of the supply range — but noise margins shrink.

✅ **Noise Margins**:  
Lower `Vdd` → reduced noise immunity → circuit becomes more sensitive to noise and supply variations.

✅ **Performance Impact**:  
Low `Vdd` operation reduces static and dynamic power — but limits noise robustness.  
High `Vdd` improves noise margin, but increases power dissipation.

While power scaling is essential for low-power design, it introduces trade-offs in noise margin and reliability — requiring careful balancing in circuit design.

This plot illustrates how the **Voltage Transfer Characteristics (VTC)** of a CMOS inverter shift with **different power supply levels (Vdd scaling)** — showing progressive reduction in noise margins as Vdd decreases.

**Advantages of using 0.5V supply:**

Using **lower Vdd (0.5V)** provides benefits like **~50% gain improvement** and **~90% reduction in energy consumption**, demonstrating the efficiency of power supply scaling in CMOS inverters.

**Disadvantage of using 0.5V supply**:

- While lowering Vdd improves gain and energy efficiency, it introduces **performance impact** — circuits may switch slower due to reduced drive strength.

🤔**How to Calculate Gain from SPICE VTC Plot??**

To calculate the gain of the CMOS inverter from the Voltage Transfer Characteristics:

1️⃣ **Click on PMOS slope** (left side of transition) — Terminal displays:  
`x0 = Vin`, `y0 = Vout`

2️⃣ **Click on NMOS slope** (right side of transition) — Terminal displays:  
`x1 = Vin`, `y1 = Vout`

3️⃣ **Compute Gain**:

Gain = (y0 − y1) / (x0 − x1)

### `Static behaviour evaluation-CMOS inverter robustness-Device variation`

#### Device Variation and CMOS Inverter Robustness

**Device variation** is one of the key factors that define the robustness of a CMOS inverter. Variations can occur due to:

- **Etching Variation**
- **Oxide Thickness Variation**

### `Etching Variation`

- **Etching** is a critical step in semiconductor fabrication.
- It defines the **physical structures** in the CMOS layout — such as **Width (W)** and **Length (L)** of transistors.

During fabrication, small deviations can occur between the **designed** and **actual** dimensions:

- **P-diffusion region** → defines the **width of PMOS gate**  
- **N-diffusion region** → defines the **width of NMOS gate**  
- **Poly-silicon layer thickness** → defines the **gate length (L)**, which corresponds to the technology node (e.g., 20nm, 30nm, 45nm).

Other key layout features impacted by etching:

- **Metal layers**
- **Contacts between layers**

#### Impact on Device Performance

- The **actual W and L** of fabricated transistors often differ from ideal values.
- Since **drain current (Id)** depends on **W** and **L**, etching variations directly affect the transistor current.
- This leads to variations in the CMOS inverter’s:

  - **Switching Threshold (Vm)**
  - **Noise Margins**
  - **Overall robustness and performance**
 
This image illustrates **etching variation** in CMOS fabrication — showing the difference between the **ideal mask (design)** and the **actual fabricated structure**.  
Variations in **W (width)** and **L (length)** occur due to process limitations, impacting **device performance** and **current drive**.

This image shows an **Inverter Chain** — a sequence of multiple CMOS inverters connected in series.  
The bottom view illustrates the **physical layout** of each inverter in the chain, showing key layers:  
Poly (Gate), P-Diffusion, N-Diffusion, VDD, VSS.  
Such chains are commonly used to study **delay**, **robustness**, and **variations** across multiple stages of logic.

### `Oxide Thickness Variation`

During MOSFET fabrication, there is often a difference between the **ideal oxide thickness** of the gate and the **actual oxide thickness** achieved.

Since **I<sub>d</sub>** depends on **C<sub>ox</sub>** (oxide capacitance), any variation in oxide thickness directly impacts the drain current (I<sub>d</sub>), thereby affecting the performance of the CMOS inverter.

The image below illustrates the difference between **ideal** and **actual** oxide thickness during fabrication:

![Alt Text](Images/6.png)

These **two minimal variations** — *etching variation* (impacting W and L) and *oxide thickness variation* — play a key role in defining the **robustness** of CMOS inverters.

Next, let's perform a **sweep of the PMOS and NMOS widths** as shown below:

![Alt Text](Images/7.png)

### `Transistor Strength Definitions:`

- **Strong PMOS**:
  - Lower resistance PMOS — provides an easier path to charge the output capacitor.
  - Achieved by using a **wider PMOS**.

- **Weak NMOS**:
  - Higher resistance NMOS — since **resistance is inversely proportional to area**.
  - Achieved by using a **narrower NMOS**.

- **Weak PMOS**:
  - Higher resistance PMOS.
  - Achieved by using a **narrower PMOS**.

- **Strong NMOS**:
  - Lower resistance NMOS.
  - Achieved by using a **wider NMOS**.

As the **PMOS width** is larger than the **NMOS width**, the PMOS provides a stronger pull-up path — causing the output to stay high for a longer duration when compared to the NMOS curve.
