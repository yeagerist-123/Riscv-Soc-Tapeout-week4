#### CMOS Inverter SPICE Deck

This image illustrates how to construct a SPICE deck for a CMOS inverter.

- **Component Connectivity**: Define how PMOS (M1), NMOS (M2), power supply (Vdd), ground (Vss), input (Vin), and output (Vout) are connected.
- **Component Values**: Specify transistor dimensions (W/L), supply voltages (e.g., 2.5V), and load capacitance (Cload = 10fF).
- **Identify Nodes**: Recognize each node in the circuit â€” such as `in`, `out`, `vdd`, `vss`, and transistor terminals.
- **Name Nodes**: Assign clear names to all nodes for ease of reference during simulation and result interpretation.

This forms the foundation of writing an accurate and functional SPICE netlist for CMOS circuit simulations.

### `Static behavior evaluation â€” CMOS inverter robustness â€” Switching threshold voltage`

The characteristics that define the **CMOS inverter robustness** are:

- **Switching Threshold Voltage (Vm)**
- **Noise Margin**
- **Power Supply Variation**
- **Device Variations**

#### Switching Threshold Voltage of CMOS Inverter (Vm):

- The **Switching Threshold Voltage (Vm)** is the voltage at which the input voltage equals the output voltage:  
  `Vin = Vout`
- It is an important parameter that impacts the noise margin and robustness of the inverter.
- At **Vm**, both the NMOS and PMOS transistors are operating in the **saturation region**, and both are turned **ON**, giving high voltage gain.

The image compares two CMOS inverters with different PMOS/NMOS sizing:

![Alt Text](Images/5.png)

  1. **Left graph**:  
     - `Wn = Wp = 0.375 Î¼m`, `Ln = Lp = 0.25 Î¼m`  
     - `(W/L)n = (W/L)p = 1.5` (equal aspect ratios)  
     - Resulting `Vm â‰ˆ 0.98 V`

  2. **Right graph**:  
     - `Wn = 0.375 Î¼m`, `Wp = 0.9375 Î¼m`, `Ln = Lp = 0.25 Î¼m`  
     - `(W/L)p = 3.75`, `(W/L)n = 1.5`  
     - Resulting `Vm â‰ˆ 1.2 V`

**Regions of operation:**

- Different regions of the curve correspond to the transistor operating regions:
  - **PMOS Linear / NMOS OFF**
  - **PMOS Linear / NMOS Saturation**
  - **PMOS Saturation / NMOS Saturation** â€” This is where `Vm` is located.
  - **PMOS Saturation / NMOS Linear**
  - **PMOS OFF / NMOS Linear**

![Alt Text](Images/6.png)

**Current balance at Vm:**

- At `Vm`, the condition:  
  `Idsp = -Idsn`  
  is satisfied â€” the current through **PMOS** equals the current through **NMOS** in magnitude but opposite in direction.

We are evaluating this at Vm, so `Vgs = Vm` for NMOS and `Vgs = Vm âˆ’ Vdd` for PMOS

![Alt Text](Images/7.png)

Equating **Idsp + Idsn = 0** and solving for **R**, we can express **Vm** as a function of the sizing ratio and mobility factors.

![Alt Text](Images/8.png)

This expression shows how the required **(Wp/Lp) / (Wn/Ln)** ratio can be computed for a given **Vm**, by balancing NMOS and PMOS currents at the switching threshold point **(Vin = Vout = Vm)**.

![Alt Text](Images/9.png)

This table shows how varying the **Wp/Wn ratio** affects:

âœ… Rise Delay  
âœ… Fall Delay  
âœ… Switching Threshold Voltage (Vm)

- When **Wp/Lp â‰ˆ 2 Ã— Wn/Ln**, the inverter achieves **balanced rise and fall delays** (â‰ˆ 80 ps each).
- At this point, the switching threshold **Vm â‰ˆ 1.2 V**.

![Alt Text](Images/10.png)

If the **rise delay** and **fall delay** of the clock buffer are well-matched, no **duty cycle distortion** correction is needed.  

However, if they are imbalanced due to PMOS/NMOS `Ron mismatch`, **duty cycle correction** circuits are used in the clock tree to maintain a 50% duty cycle.
